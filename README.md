## Testing

The project was tested on development tools in Google Chrome and the responsiveness of mobile devices and Ipads was also tested.

- Moto G4
- Galaxy S5
- Pixel 2
- Pixel 2XL 
- Iphone 5/SE 
- Iphone 6/7/8
- Iphone 6/7/8Plus
- IphoneX
- Ipad
- Ipad Pro 
- Surface Duo 
- Galaxy Fold 

The first of the testing steps was on W3C Markup Validation and W3C CSS validation with no errors found.

The second of testing steps was http://ami.responsivedesign.is/, which has been used to see how the site performs on different devices and their viewports. All pages, links, icons performed as expected on all devices. I also used it to create the all-devices.jpg at the top of this Readme file.

The third step was testing by the Slack community, my mentor from the Code Institute and my friends and family.

Testing consists of finding any errors that could reveal the incorrect operation of the website during its use. The website was also tested on private mobile devices like Iphone7, Samsung A20 and Ipad 7.

All problems related to the functioning of the site have been resolved.
