## UX

This game is meant to be fun, but also develop your memory skills at the same time. Mostly intended for children, but people of all ages can play it. More advanced players can start at more difficult levels, and enjoy themselves while giving their memory a little bit of a workout. 


The following user stories have been identified:

1. As a user, I want the home screen to be visually appealing, making me want to try the game.
2. As a user, I want to be able to start the game easily.
3. As a user, I want to be able to choose a difficulty level.
4. As a user, I want to be provided with instructions on how to play the game.
5. As a user, I want to be able to restart the game without going back to the home page.
6. As a user, I want to know if I lose or win the game.
7. As a user, I want to have fun.

## Technologies Used

### Language

- HTML - standard language used to create this page.
- CSS - standard language that describes the style of HTML.
- Javascript - standard language for game functions.
- Bootstrap CDN - used as the core structuring layout for the application, ensuring mobile-first design and screen size fluidity.
- Github - used to host the repository.
- JQuery - used to simplify DOM manipulation. 

### Tools Used

- Google Fonts - to style the website fonts.

## Testing

The project was tested on development tools in Google Chrome and the responsiveness of mobile devices and Ipads was also tested.

- Moto G4
- Galaxy S5
- Pixel 2
- Pixel 2XL 
- Iphone 5/SE 
- Iphone 6/7/8
- Iphone 6/7/8Plus
- IphoneX
- Ipad
- Ipad Pro 
- Surface Duo 
- Galaxy Fold 

The first of the testing steps was on W3C Markup Validation and W3C CSS validation with no errors found.

The second testing step was http://ami.responsivedesign.is/, which has been used to see how the site performs on different devices and their viewports. All pages, links, icons performed as expected on all devices. I also used it to create the all-devices.jpg at the top of this Readme file.

The third step was testing by the Slack community, my mentor from the Code Institute and my friends and family.

Testing consists of finding any errors that could reveal incorrect operation of the website during its use. The website was also tested on private mobile devices like Iphone 7, Samsung A20 and Ipad 7.

All problems related to the functioning of the site have been resolved.
